# MetaMeet

MetaMeet is a decentralized, web 3.0-native social meetup platform where you can build the perfect hang-out spot!

At the most basic level, MetaMeet is a lot like Zoom or Google Meet - you can create a meeting room with a name and a scheduled time, and you can share a link to the room so others can join you. But beyond that, your meetup experience is what you make it to be thanks to a variety of plug-and-play web 3.0 protocol integrations, including Textile, Livepeer, Unlock Protocol, POAP, and IPFS.
